How to do effective executive summaries for other execs, your bosses, or clients, etc:

1. one paragraph summary
2. Key data or info/assumptions
3. three options/actions
4. Your recommendation, and why, and potential risks.
5. Next steps

One of the very lacking skills that I see among employees, 
and even other business owners, is the inability to create effective executive summaries.
Being able to write a one-page executive summary is not even as much about the writing of it, 
but that it forces you to describe a complex situation with facts and only the key information succinctly.
This will help you immeasurably as a businessperson, employee, everything
Even if you don't need to write one out, this is the same order and format that you would speak it out
