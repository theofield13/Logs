	- Gaprisk: t.ex. banken har gett ut bolån på 3 år med fast ränta. 
	  Detta har finansierats med rörlig ränta, om markandsränta stiger => kostnad för utlåning stiger men "inlåning vinst öker inte på 3 år"

My productivity app is a never-ending .txt file
By Jeff Huang, updated on 2022-03-21
The biggest transition for me when I started college was learning to get organized. There was a point when I couldn't just remember everything in my head. And having to constantly keep track of things was distracting me from whatever task I was doing at the moment.

So I tried various forms of todo lists, task trackers, and productivity apps. They were all discouraging because the things to do kept getting longer, and there were too many interrelated things like past meeting notes, calendar appointments, idea lists, and lab notebooks, which were all on different systems.

I gave up and started just tracking in a single text file and have been using it as my main productivity system for 14 years now. It is so essential to my work now, and has surprisingly scaled with a growing set of responsibilities, that I wanted to share this system. It's been my secret weapon.

Prerequisite: A calendar. The one outside tool I use is an online calendar, and I put everything on this calendar, even things that aren't actually for a fixed time like "make a coffee table at the workshop" or "figure out how to recruit new PhD students" — I'll schedule them on a date when I want to think about it. That way all my future plans and schedule are together, and not a bunch of lists I have to keep track of.

Making the Daily List: Every night before I go to bed, I take all the items on my calendar for the next day and append it to the end of the text file as a daily todo list, so I know exactly what I'm doing when I wake up. This list contains scheduled tasks (2pm meeting with Madonna, 4pm office hours), errands (sign a form, return a book), and work items (review a paper, prepare a presentation). It also lets me think about whether I've got the right amount of work for a day.

Anything I don't want to do tomorrow, I'll shuffle back into my calendar on later dates. If the task is too big, I'll break it down into a piece for tomorrow, and the rest for another date. After years of doing this, I've gotten pretty good at estimating what I can finish in a day. Here's an example with names replaced so you can see what it looks like when I move a day's schedule from my calendar.

2021-11-31
11am meet with Head TAs
- where are things at with inviting portfolio reviewers?
11:30am meet with student Enya (interested in research)
review and release A/B Testing assignment grading
12pm HCI group meeting
- vote for lab snacks
send reminders for CHI external reviewers
read Sketchy draft
Zelda pick up eye tracker
- have her sign for it
update biosketch for Co-PI
3:15pm join call with Umbrella Corp and industry partnership staff
3:45pm advising meet with Oprah
4pm Rihanna talk (368 CIT)
5pm 1:1 with Beyonce #phdadvisee
6pm faculty interview dinner with Madonna

As a Record: That daily todo list is where I also take notes, so it's a to do list that turns into a what done list. The best thing about these daily lists is I keep them all in a single text file separated by dates, so I have a record of everything I have ever done and when I did it.

My current file was created 9 years ago when I started my current job. It serves as a research notebook, and as meeting minutes. I have 51,690 handwritten lines in one file now, documenting everything I have done as a professor, and nearly every person I have met with, along with notes about what we discussed or ideas I had. Here's what my list looks like at the end of the day, representing work accomplished.

- vote #HIRE
#note maybe visit Monsters University next spring, Bono does related work

Shortcuts and Features: I use a consistent writing style so things are easily searchable, with a few shorthands. When I search for "meet with", it shows that I have had over 3,000 scheduled meetings. I have some tags like #idea for new ideas to revisit when I want project ideas, #annual for things to put on my next annual report, #nextui for things to add the next time I run my next UI course.

A text file is incredibly flexible, and at any point, I can quickly glance to see what I've done that day and what's left. I usually keep an empty line between tasks completed and upcoming tasks. When a task is completed, I move the empty line. Any leftover tasks from the current day can go back into the calendar for when I may want to tackle it again, but that is rare because tasks were already sized into what I can do on that day. I can calculate aggregate statistics using the search box, or list all the lines containing a tag, and other operations using my text editor. I use Ultraedit because I'm familiar with it, but any text editor would have similar capabilities.

Email: Email is obviously a part of my workflow. Everyone has all sorts of productivity advice about handling it, but I find a simple flagging system is sufficient — flag Red if it's something I need to deal with, flag Orange if I need to deal with it eventually but requires some thinking or someone else to handle it, and flag Yellow for emails I send that I am waiting on a reply for, so I know to follow up later. I'll flag emails as they come in, whenever it's convenient.

At the end of the day, I'll do a quick review of the Orange and Yellows to see if any need to be followed up or should become Red. Some peoples' workflows revolve around obsessively cleaning their Inbox. I don't really care about keeping my inbox empty because then I feel like I have new work to do whenever email comes in.

So my daily routine looks like

look at the daily todo list I wrote last night to find out what I'm doing today
do scheduled things on that list during the day
when I have free (unscheduled) time, do the floating tasks on my list and work on Red-flagged emails
at the end of the day
do a quick review of Orange/Yellow emails to see if they need any handling
copy the next day's calendar items to the bottom of the text file
This process has a few nice properties:

It's easy to immediately see what to do when I wake up
I don't need to remember in my head the things to do later (following up on emails, future tasks)
It's easy to recall what happened in the past and see how much I can actually accomplish in a day
There's no running "todo" list with items that keep pushed back day after day
I use Remote Desktop so everything is accessible from every device
My daily workload is completely under my control the night before; whenever I feel overwhelmed with my long-term commitments, I reduce it by aggressively unflagging emails, removing items from my calendar that I am no longer excited about doing, and reducing how much work I assign myself in the future.

It does mean sometimes I miss some questions or don't pursue an interesting research question, but helps me maintain a manageable workload.

BowtiedBull journal 1
###########################################################################################################################

Morning routines are viral because they don’t work. Anything the masses obsess over? Doesn’t work. Otherwise it wouldn’t be something that is popular with NPCs.

Instead its two levels of accountability and consistency. Unless you’re completely unaware of your body, you’ll already know which hours of the day are your best, your worst and medium/average.

Create *blocks* of time over the course of a full week. 80% is focused on work 20% on fitness/partying. 
This is a gradient (sliding scale) but we’re under the assumption someone is far behind on the WiFi Money/Wealth side. 
If you’re on track there you can slide the percentages a bit (health needs more effort as you age)

Everyone wants an aesthetic “morning routine.”

Four Simple Blocks of Time:
 1) Intense Work Block, high effort, 2) Regular W-2 Block, medium effort, 3) Workout time, medium effort and 4) social/no effort - low energy state since none is needed.

After this you need to take out a journal once per day. You will not write some sob story dear diary in it. 
You will write (physical) three sentences: 
1) what you did today to improve on main issue, 
2) what you will do tomorrow and 
3) your 3-5 year main objective and if you’re optimizing your time correctly. Needs to be a resounding yes.

These three sentences take less than a couple minutes. The value is huge though. 
Impossible to go to sleep every night peacefully if you write “didn’t do anything” in sentence one for more than a day. More of an Accountability Check than a Journal.

BTB Lazy Newbie Guide to Journals
This is going to be a refresher for people who have been around for years. Essentially, most people have an accountability issue. 
It is no surprise that when you’re taking Tequilla shots with Push Up Bra Susan every weekend, you don’t really develop good habits. This is normal. 
When you’re younger, you have so much energy that it is hard to even comprehend. This leads to irrational and near-term decision making.

THREE SENTENCE JOURNAL FOR NEWBIES
In this environment, where you know you’re not moving in the right direction we have three simple sentences to write. 
The only catch is you need to answer three questions before moving on:

- What is the main thing you’re trying to achieve? One sentence answer

- What is the second most important thing you’re trying to get achieve. One sentence answer

- What is the primary personal life item you are working on? One Sentence Answer

After you have this done you can now go ahead and journal 1x a day before bed. You can do it first thing in the morning or before bed. We recommend doing it before bed
By doing the three sentence answer before bed you will create significant peace or restlessness. If you’re writing “did nothing” every single day, you will have to stew with that on your mind as you fall asleep. 
If you write something clearly actionable daily? You’ll sleep instantly since you know you’re making the right decisions.

EXAMPLE GOOD ANSWERS: 
Start a business doing XYZ. Earn more money on the internet, in real estate etc. Lose 10 lbs of body fat. Take up a healthier hobby such as golf instead of drinking 2 days a week (moving to 1x).

ACCOUNTABILITY
As you can see by having three clear tasks and three clear sentences you will go insane writing “didn’t set up S Corp” or “Didn’t go to the gym” or “Didn’t message so and so to get Item A rolling”

This also gives you two main improvement points and a third “personality” based item. It could be as simple as learning a new language, getting in shape or learning how to dance. 
Frankly don’t care. This makes sure you’re focused on two main items and a third item to prevent you from becoming a robot/aspergers type.

Example Entry: Assumes goal is to make money online, reduce work hours at W-2 and get in shape.

In this format something like this would show real progress:

“I researched on TikTok and narrowed down to XYZ product targeting women”

“I found a way to create an automated tool to reduce work hours by 30 mins on a monthly excel document”

“I went to the gym and lifted for 45 minutes despite being out in a hotel for work”

If you look closely at this format. The next day you can’t say “I research the same thing on TikTok” or “I automated the same product”. This format *forces* you to show progress.

If you get into this standard habit which takes less than 3 minutes a day, you will see your productivity spike. Once you’re more scaled up? Look at the overview from Tiger!

He knows because he’s clinically insane.

New Year Skill Development: Internalizing Motivation
###########################################################################################################################

Welcome Avatar! As long-term readers know, the New Year is the time to stay in. Instead of coming up with some singular goal that must be achieved in one year 
(which people quit by February), instead we suggest creating a protocol you will follow for life. This sounds daunting but it’ll create internal motivation. 
You won’t need to blow money going to some Tony Robbins Seminar (Michael Jordan/Lebron James never attended one before the NBA finals).

You want to create inevitability.

If you limit yourself to a single year or a “timeline to success” you’ll end up quitting before the big win comes. 
Anyone successful that is honest with you will explain that they know hundreds/thousands of people who simply gave up too early. 
They didn’t hit their specific one year goal or their “make it all in one cycle” goal. They anchor themselves to a specific day to make it which just results in an early exit.

Again. We recognize the vast majority of people will end up making it within about 3 years of true grind/effort/eating glass. 
This doesn’t mean there is a magical door that opens at the end of year three. Maybe your breakthrough is 3.5 years. Maybe it is 1.5 years. 
Maybe you hit it "giga rich” at 42 when your goal was 40. Does it matter? No.

The objective is to create a system that makes success inevitable.

##
The NPC Majority
##
Instead of starting today, they wait for some specific time to start “New Years Day”. They need some magical new idea (instead of iterating on something with real demand now). 
They make excuses. The excuses include the perfect: 1) idea, 2) time, 3) market conditions, 4) competitive advantage or 5) brain chemistry hack.

Next thing you know it is January 15, 2026 and they’ve done nothing.

This isn’t just a problem, it is a catastrophic failure. A level 10/10 emergency stealing their most valuable asset: time. 
Time is the most expensive thing in the world and burning it waiting for January 1 is simply for NPCs and NGMIs.

Adding fuel to this fire? The next decade is going to be transformative. You will see individuals become completely sovereign. 
Running 7-9 figure businesses with less than a handful of people. The Jungle already has multiple public examples of this. 
We’re not aware of a single different community that does this. The other groups simply have some guy yelling about how $10M is not a lot of money and you’re all poor relative to him/her. 
A load of unhealthy non-sense.

Everyone starts at the bottom, everyone cross the finish line at a different time. The key is making sure that you are always *in the race*. “Quitting” isn’t a option. 
Losing isn’t an option. Your process and system makes it inevitable. The only question is when not “if”.

##
The New Economy
##
Due to AI and other technology advances? You are no longer shackled by the annoying and untrue statement “need to know someone to make it”.

Fact is, you already have access to everyone you “need to know” via the internet

Instead, the next decade is entirely about execution. 
People will spend all day outsourcing their thinking to AI models, you’ll be taking the same models to remove overhead and free up time to be a producer/operator/executor

If you’re constantly iterating (attempting to improve) your WiFi business, personal life, fitness etc. There is nearly no chance that you fail on a long time horizon. 
Least we haven’t seen it.

Luck isn’t needed when you create it yourself.

...

If you want to be a decision maker it means you need to *stick* to investments, *stick* with building ideas, *stick* to the KPIs and *stick* to your plan of action. 
Ignore what everyone else is doing and just focus on you. Your plan. Your genetic advantage. Your data sets/feedback loop. 

Once all the reps are done, you’ll naturally find yourself into a bigger decision making role.

##
Social Feedback Issue
##
By constantly switching gears and juggling, you’re on this never ending treadmill of hype. Your next idea is “the one”. Everyone pretends to be excited for you and cheers you on. 
Your first attempt was a flop but “you got it this time bro”

You’re not living for results in this case, you’re living for attention. Not a good strategy.

In the real world, results require long and painful lull periods. It looks like nothing is happening. That’s ironically where everything is happening. Lots of nothing then a step function up. Improvement isn’t linear.

This is the price of compounding. Many people hear “7% CAGR” for the S&P 500. They visualize every year is +7%. 
In reality it is more like +3%, +12%, -5%, +18%, +3%, -10%, +25%, 0%, 0%, -5%, +15%… so on and so forth. 
After 30 years of this the eventual CAGR is about 7%.

Time Preference is Your Advantage
##
Quick dopamine hits are being commoditized at an alarming rate. Even today there are people who sit on AI apps and just “talk to it” all day. 
They feel like they are learning something but they are really just wasting time.

So Who Comes Out Ahead? The person with low time preference. The person who chooses a clear niche, runs in that direction, iterates a billion times if needed and continues to follow through based on results/information. 
No emotion. No need to “ask AI”. The real time data is being given to you. Nothing to “ask”.

More doing. Less asking.

No excuse of not having the right “connections”. The only connection you need is an internet connection. 
That and the guts to continuously get feed back even if a lot of it is negative at first.

Eventually this all compounds and the next thing you know? You’re able to have high time preference. 
The big joke in the end is that you won’t enjoy it and will be back to low time preference projects to keep sane.

Anyway. Competition is getting easily distracted by the day. Don’t let this be you.

Create a Follow Through Protocol
####
The best quote on this topic is here: “Done is better than perfect” ~ Anne Mollegen Smith

It is actually profound if you understand it. By completing the task you get access to information. This makes the next attempt at being “done” closer to perfection anyway.

Follow through, again and again and again.

Here is a simple program to prevent you from wasting time and energy.

###
One Mission Only
###

If you’re struggling at all with progress, this means you’re allowed only one major mission. If 80%+ of your free time is not spent on that? You should be stressed out beyond belief.

Make it trackable: 1) number of ads tested, 2) number of units sold, 3) number of products launched, 4) number of outbound calls made… so on and so forth. 
We don’t know your specific starting point but it should be measurable.

Since we’re big on 3 line basic journaling, this means your main objective should be one line.

“The main goal is WiFi money and I will demand test every X days until Y result”

###
Two Deep Work Blocks Per Day
###

Make this non-negotiable. You will block off two time periods every single day to produce. Produce does not mean watch a youtube video or ask AI some obscure question. 
You need to be producing something to get to that main goal.

Your free time *outside* of this window can 100% be used to read, research, watch videos etc. The deep work period is for work = output

If you need an extra rule of thumb about 75 minute is a good block period without drifting and getting distracted. 
This adds up to 2.5 hours per day of no excuses output.

Turn on a timer if you have to. Go to a library if you have to. No distractions allowed. Phone is turned off.

No “thinking of ideas” excuses. The 21.5 hours of free time can be burned on thinking/researching etc.

###
Daily Minimum Prevents Quitting
###

By setting up like this, you are training your brain for two things: 
1) you’re seeing tangible long-term results and 
2) each day the goal isn’t to “win” it is to complete the full 2.5 hours of real intense work.

You are tracking a KPI and you’re tracking follow through. Soon enough it is 30 days of deep work. Next thing you know it is 5 years and you’ve already sold something.

The Tricky Part: Life is always going to throw you a curve ball. You might catch the flu. You might have a family emergency. So on and so forth.

In this case you still need a *minimum* output amount. For fun we will call it 30 minutes. Feel terrible and sick? Still put in those 30 minutes. 
Emergency? Cool still need to do the minimum.

The reason for this is both psychological and momentum based. You will feel stronger and more accomplished by getting through it. 
Also. You won’t stop the momentum you’ve built up the past month, year or years before this wrench got thrown in.

Now your identity is “No matter what happens I still get things done some how some way”

This is where long-term confidence is built.

###
Journal Review
###
Now you have your basic journal: 
1) sentence mission and objective written in their as achieved or not - add in a number for hours of deep work, 
2) what you need to implement tomorrow and 
3) current assumption on what the root issue is

There will not be a “Eureka!” moment. This isn’t Disney. What you will find is hat you slowly make tweaks based on the changing view of the root cause. 
Eventually all those small changes lead to increasing speed/momentum. 
Then you’re just increasing more and more speed/momentum and you will look back and say “wow there is actually no day to pinpoint when this started to take off”. 
All you know is that the step function happened. That’s how the real world works.

You don’t adjust the hours of effort. You are only going to adjust the direction of that effort. If you need to focus on ads then focus on ads. 
If you need to focus on fixing the product packaging… switch the hours to fixing the product packaging.

The only constant is the follow through. When it’s done, ship it and move on. No need for perfect or another excuse about some 50th business idea.

###
No In the Moment Decisions
###
Could be high, could be low. You do not want to make any decisions in a big moment. Don’t go house hunting if you just sold your business. 
Don’t give up on your idea just because an ad you worked on was a total flop.

The best way to prevent this is by training your subconscious. 
When you wake up and are barely functioning, drink some water and just jot down the first 2-3 things you’ll do during the deep work time frame 
“open ad 1, check KPIs” 
“Open ad 2, check KPIs” 
“Look at snapshot comparison”

It sounds silly at first, however you’ll find yourself doing *exactly* that the moment you sit down. Your brain was working out the details during your day. (seriously, this does happen)

If you want a real old person analogy, it would be like warming up the heater on an old car before driving it.

###
Terrible Day Minimums
###
We do try our best to set the standard here even with this fun website. We don’t really take time off. We’re consistent. We follow through.

That said, we do have “bad days” and “life events” just like you. In those cases you want to have back burner items you can get done in a shorter amount of time. 
This will keep momentum going for you. Perhaps you only have 1 hour to commit instead of the usual 3 hours. That’s good enough.

Make a minimum and consider it a win since you didn’t break the “win streak”. Use professional sports ball as an example. 
Maybe you only play 20 minutes that game because you were sick. Well good enough. If the win came through, that’s more than enough.

Consistency creates a new identity. New identity creates momentum. Momentum creates inevitable results.

If your score board is following through and repetitions, you remove the emotion from the entire equation. Every single day some one-hit wonder will show up. 
Every single day someone loses everything as well. Don’t stare at the one-hit wonder and say “why me” if you’re ignoring the levered degen who just lost everything in one trade.

Consistency creates a new identity. That identity is forward progress on your main one objective (later on you can do about three).

No need for calendars beyond the reminder. If it’s a holiday maybe it is a minimum work day. Maybe it isn’t. 
However. Work will be done. Not going to use a random day on the calendar to change your emotions and impact your life.

Your results will look “lucky” to people who continue to move from idea to idea… banking on hope.

Hope isn’t a strategy.

Follow through and KPIs are.

###
“Maybe I’ll Start in 2026…”
###
Sorry. This is an “already lost” point of view.

Instead, start immediately. No one needs to wait for some magical calendar to read 2026. Start now. 
Today you decide what the main issue is. Tomorrow you start moving into the direction of solving that main issue.

You can do all this right now: 1) main goal in one sentence, 2) when you will do the deep work, 3) what the specific task will be and 4) how you will measure it.

Add this time block to your calendar on “repeat forever”. Clock starts ticking and your iPhone will remind you for good.

The notification will hit you 100x harder than any random app you’ve got!

Repeat, repeat, repeat.
