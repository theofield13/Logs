My productivity app is a never-ending .txt file
By Jeff Huang, updated on 2022-03-21
The biggest transition for me when I started college was learning to get organized. There was a point when I couldn't just remember everything in my head. And having to constantly keep track of things was distracting me from whatever task I was doing at the moment.

So I tried various forms of todo lists, task trackers, and productivity apps. They were all discouraging because the things to do kept getting longer, and there were too many interrelated things like past meeting notes, calendar appointments, idea lists, and lab notebooks, which were all on different systems.

I gave up and started just tracking in a single text file and have been using it as my main productivity system for 14 years now. It is so essential to my work now, and has surprisingly scaled with a growing set of responsibilities, that I wanted to share this system. It's been my secret weapon.

Prerequisite: A calendar. The one outside tool I use is an online calendar, and I put everything on this calendar, even things that aren't actually for a fixed time like "make a coffee table at the workshop" or "figure out how to recruit new PhD students" — I'll schedule them on a date when I want to think about it. That way all my future plans and schedule are together, and not a bunch of lists I have to keep track of.

Making the Daily List: Every night before I go to bed, I take all the items on my calendar for the next day and append it to the end of the text file as a daily todo list, so I know exactly what I'm doing when I wake up. This list contains scheduled tasks (2pm meeting with Madonna, 4pm office hours), errands (sign a form, return a book), and work items (review a paper, prepare a presentation). It also lets me think about whether I've got the right amount of work for a day.

Anything I don't want to do tomorrow, I'll shuffle back into my calendar on later dates. If the task is too big, I'll break it down into a piece for tomorrow, and the rest for another date. After years of doing this, I've gotten pretty good at estimating what I can finish in a day. Here's an example with names replaced so you can see what it looks like when I move a day's schedule from my calendar.

As a Record: That daily todo list is where I also take notes, so it's a to do list that turns into a what done list. The best thing about these daily lists is I keep them all in a single text file separated by dates, so I have a record of everything I have ever done and when I did it.

My current file was created 9 years ago when I started my current job. It serves as a research notebook, and as meeting minutes. I have 51,690 handwritten lines in one file now, documenting everything I have done as a professor, and nearly every person I have met with, along with notes about what we discussed or ideas I had. Here's what my list looks like at the end of the day, representing work accomplished.

Shortcuts and Features: I use a consistent writing style so things are easily searchable, with a few shorthands. When I search for "meet with", it shows that I have had over 3,000 scheduled meetings. I have some tags like #idea for new ideas to revisit when I want project ideas, #annual for things to put on my next annual report, #nextui for things to add the next time I run my next UI course.

A text file is incredibly flexible, and at any point, I can quickly glance to see what I've done that day and what's left. I usually keep an empty line between tasks completed and upcoming tasks. When a task is completed, I move the empty line. Any leftover tasks from the current day can go back into the calendar for when I may want to tackle it again, but that is rare because tasks were already sized into what I can do on that day. I can calculate aggregate statistics using the search box, or list all the lines containing a tag, and other operations using my text editor. I use Ultraedit because I'm familiar with it, but any text editor would have similar capabilities.

Email: Email is obviously a part of my workflow. Everyone has all sorts of productivity advice about handling it, but I find a simple flagging system is sufficient — flag Red if it's something I need to deal with, flag Orange if I need to deal with it eventually but requires some thinking or someone else to handle it, and flag Yellow for emails I send that I am waiting on a reply for, so I know to follow up later. I'll flag emails as they come in, whenever it's convenient.

At the end of the day, I'll do a quick review of the Orange and Yellows to see if any need to be followed up or should become Red. Some peoples' workflows revolve around obsessively cleaning their Inbox. I don't really care about keeping my inbox empty because then I feel like I have new work to do whenever email comes in.

So my daily routine looks like

look at the daily todo list I wrote last night to find out what I'm doing today
do scheduled things on that list during the day
when I have free (unscheduled) time, do the floating tasks on my list and work on Red-flagged emails
at the end of the day
do a quick review of Orange/Yellow emails to see if they need any handling
copy the next day's calendar items to the bottom of the text file
This process has a few nice properties:

It's easy to immediately see what to do when I wake up
I don't need to remember in my head the things to do later (following up on emails, future tasks)
It's easy to recall what happened in the past and see how much I can actually accomplish in a day
There's no running "todo" list with items that keep pushed back day after day
I use Remote Desktop so everything is accessible from every device
My daily workload is completely under my control the night before; whenever I feel overwhelmed with my long-term commitments, I reduce it by aggressively unflagging emails, removing items from my calendar that I am no longer excited about doing, and reducing how much work I assign myself in the future.

It does mean sometimes I miss some questions or don't pursue an interesting research question, but helps me maintain a manageable workload.

Morning routines are viral because they don’t work. Anything the masses obsess over? Doesn’t work. Otherwise it wouldn’t be something that is popular with NPCs.

Instead its two levels of accountability and consistency. Unless you’re completely unaware of your body, you’ll already know which hours of the day are your best, your worst and medium/average.

Create *blocks* of time over the course of a full week. 80% is focused on work 20% on fitness/partying. 
This is a gradient (sliding scale) but we’re under the assumption someone is far behind on the WiFi Money/Wealth side. 
If you’re on track there you can slide the percentages a bit (health needs more effort as you age)

Everyone wants an aesthetic “morning routine.”

Four Simple Blocks of Time:
 1) Intense Work Block, high effort, 2) Regular W-2 Block, medium effort, 3) Workout time, medium effort and 4) social/no effort - low energy state since none is needed.

After this you need to take out a journal once per day. You will not write some sob story dear diary in it. 
You will write (physical) three sentences: 
1) what you did today to improve on main issue, 
2) what you will do tomorrow and 
3) your 3-5 year main objective and if you’re optimizing your time correctly. Needs to be a resounding yes.

These three sentences take less than a couple minutes. The value is huge though. 
Impossible to go to sleep every night peacefully if you write “didn’t do anything” in sentence one for more than a day. More of an Accountability Check than a Journal.

BTB Lazy Newbie Guide to Journals
This is going to be a refresher for people who have been around for years. Essentially, most people have an accountability issue. 
It is no surprise that when you’re taking Tequilla shots with Push Up Bra Susan every weekend, you don’t really develop good habits. This is normal. 
When you’re younger, you have so much energy that it is hard to even comprehend. This leads to irrational and near-term decision making.

THREE SENTENCE JOURNAL FOR NEWBIES
In this environment, where you know you’re not moving in the right direction we have three simple sentences to write. 
The only catch is you need to answer three questions before moving on:

- What is the main thing you’re trying to achieve? One sentence answer

- What is the second most important thing you’re trying to get achieve. One sentence answer

- What is the primary personal life item you are working on? One Sentence Answer

After you have this done you can now go ahead and journal 1x a day before bed. You can do it first thing in the morning or before bed. We recommend doing it before bed
By doing the three sentence answer before bed you will create significant peace or restlessness. If you’re writing “did nothing” every single day, you will have to stew with that on your mind as you fall asleep. 
If you write something clearly actionable daily? You’ll sleep instantly since you know you’re making the right decisions.

EXAMPLE GOOD ANSWERS: 
Start a business doing XYZ. Earn more money on the internet, in real estate etc. Lose 10 lbs of body fat. Take up a healthier hobby such as golf instead of drinking 2 days a week (moving to 1x).

ACCOUNTABILITY
As you can see by having three clear tasks and three clear sentences you will go insane writing “didn’t set up S Corp” or “Didn’t go to the gym” or “Didn’t message so and so to get Item A rolling”

This also gives you two main improvement points and a third “personality” based item. It could be as simple as learning a new language, getting in shape or learning how to dance. 
Frankly don’t care. This makes sure you’re focused on two main items and a third item to prevent you from becoming a robot/aspergers type.

Example Entry: Assumes goal is to make money online, reduce work hours at W-2 and get in shape.

In this format something like this would show real progress:

“I researched on TikTok and narrowed down to XYZ product targeting women”

“I found a way to create an automated tool to reduce work hours by 30 mins on a monthly excel document”

“I went to the gym and lifted for 45 minutes despite being out in a hotel for work”

If you look closely at this format. The next day you can’t say “I research the same thing on TikTok” or “I automated the same product”. This format *forces* you to show progress.

If you get into this standard habit which takes less than 3 minutes a day, you will see your productivity spike. Once you’re more scaled up? Look at the overview from Tiger!

He knows because he’s clinically insane.
